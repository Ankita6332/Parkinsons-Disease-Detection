Detection of Parkinsons Disease using Classification Algorithms
•	Parkinson's disease (PD) is progressive neurodegenerative disorder that affects a lot of people significantly affecting their quality of life. 
•	It mostly affects the motor functions of humans.
•	The symptoms of Parkinson's disease will occur slowly, the symptoms include shaking, rigidity, slowness of movement and difficulty with walking, Thinking and behaviour change, Depression and anxiety are also common.
•	If a person has Parkinson disease or not is predicted by comparing different machine learning algorithms such as Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN) and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XG Boost). 
•	The accuracy score of the algorithms is compared and the best algorithm is chosen that gives the highest accuracy rate in predicting the Parkinson disease.
